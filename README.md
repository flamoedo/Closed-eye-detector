This app is a example of using OpenCV and artificial integilence in Android.

This driver fatigue monitoring app "Driver Fatigue Alarm System" utilizes camera image capture and digital image processing. With its artificial intelligence algorithms, it ensures that the driver will be promptly warned when fatigue occurs to protect life and property.
 
Drivers are usually not aware that they are fatigued until the actual accident happens. One of the most important functions of the early warning system is to let motorists understand that they are actually in fatigue driving and raise their alertness level. Once the system detects that the driver is under fatigue driving, it will send a warning signal immediately to the driver.
 
In some circumstances, a driver will probably fall asleep suddenly due to driving fatigue; The warning system will make a sound to wake the driver, which is the other very important function of this system.
 
When the warning of fatigue sounds, the driver must lean immediately to take a rest and avoid an accident. If the driver continues to drive without any action, the system will remind the driver, sounding alert, whenever necessary.
